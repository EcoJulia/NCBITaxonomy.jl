The keyword argument verbose (default to false) indicates whether the distance to a fuzzy match must be printed.\n\nUnder strict matching, if no match is found, the namefinder will return nothing. This can be used to switch to the fuzzy namefinder automatically. The fuzzy namefinder uses the findnearest function from StringDistances, which will always return something. The compare function from the same package may be used to see how similar the names are, and to decide whether to keep them.\n\nAltough the input dataframe is supposed to be a subset of the (unexported) names_table, all that is required is that it has the columns tax_id, name, and class.
