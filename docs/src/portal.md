# Use-case: the portal data

In this example, we will use `NCBITaxonomy` to validate the names of the species
used in the Portal teaching dataset:

> Ernest, Morgan; Brown, James; Valone, Thomas; White, Ethan P. (2017): Portal
> Project Teaching Database. figshare.
> https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459.v6

We will download a list of species from figshare, which is given as a JSON file:

```@example portal
using NCBITaxonomy
using DataFrames
using JSON

species_file = download("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299486")
species = JSON.parsefile(species_file)
```

There is are two things we want to do at this point: extract the species names
from the file, and then validate that they are spelled correctly, or that they
are the most recent taxonomic name according to NCBI.

We will store our results in a data frame:

```@example portal
cleanup = DataFrame(
    code = String[],
    portal = String[],
    name = String[],
    rank = Symbol[],
    order = String[],
    taxid = Int[]
)
```

The next step is to loop throug the species, and figure out what to do with
them:

```@example portal
for sp in species
    portal_name = sp["species"] == "sp." ? sp["genus"] : sp["genus"]*" "*sp["species"]
    ncbi_tax = taxid(portal_name)
    if isnothing(ncbi_tax)
        ncbi_tax = taxid(portal_name; fuzzy=true)
    end
    ncbi_lin = lineage(ncbi_tax)
    push!(cleanup,
        (
            sp["species_id"], portal_name, ncbi_tax.name, rank(ncbi_tax),
            first(filter(t -> isequal(:order)(rank(t)), lineage(ncbi_tax))).name,
            ncbi_tax.id
        )
    )
end

first(cleanup, 5)
```

Finally, we can look at the codes for which there is a likely issue because the
names do not match -- this can be because of new names, improper use of
vernacular, or spelling issues:

```@example portal
filter(r -> r.portal != r.name, cleanup)
```

Note that these results should *always* be manually curated. For example, two
species have been assigned to groups that are *obiously* wrong:

```@example portal
filter(r -> r.order âˆˆ ["Gentianales","Hemiptera"], cleanup)
```

How can we fix this?

Well, the obvious choice here is *manual cleaning*. This is a good solution.
Another thing that `NCBITaxonomy` offers is the ability to build a `namefinder`
from a list of known NCBI taxa. This is good if we know that the names we expect
to find are part of a reference list.
